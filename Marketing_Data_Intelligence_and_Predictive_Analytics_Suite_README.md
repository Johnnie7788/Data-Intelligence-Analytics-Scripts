# Marketing Data Intelligence and Predictive Analytics Suite

## Overview
The **Marketing Data Intelligence and Predictive Analytics Suite** is a Python-based tool designed to empower marketing teams with advanced analytics and predictive insights. This suite is ideal for analyzing multi-channel marketing data (e.g., Paid Search, Social Media, Display), forecasting budget needs, and calculating profitability metrics, all of which support data-backed decision-making in dynamic business environments.

Designed for data analysts and marketing strategists, the suite provides end-to-end functionalities, from extracting insights on campaign performance to offering recommendations based on robust data intelligence models.

## Key Features
1. **Performance Analysis**: Visualize marketing spend and ROI across various channels over time, identifying key trends and performance patterns.
2. **Predictive Budget Modeling**: Use Gradient Boosting to forecast budget requirements, enabling precise, data-driven budget planning.
3. **Multi-Touch Attribution Modeling**: Implement multi-touch attribution to credit conversions to respective channels, gaining insights into channel impact.
4. **Incrementality Testing (A/B Testing)**: Conduct A/B tests to evaluate the incremental lift of campaigns, validating strategy effectiveness.
5. **Profitability Metrics Calculation**: Calculate key financial metrics like Cost Per Acquisition (CPA), Lifetime Value (LTV), and profitability, supporting strategic financial assessments.

## Installation
To set up and run the script, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scipy matplotlib seaborn sqlalchemy
```

## Usage
1. **SQL Database Setup**: Set up your SQL database connection string (e.g., `sqlite:///marketing_analytics.db`) and ensure the data table is prepared.
   
2. **Data Requirements**: The suite expects a SQL table named `marketing_performance_data` with columns:
   - `date` (Date in format: YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `spend` (Marketing spend per channel)
   - `roi` (Return on investment)
   - `channel` (Channel name, e.g., Paid Search, Social Media)
   - `campaign_type` (Type of campaign for A/B testing)
   - `conversions` (Number of conversions)

3. **Running the Script**: Execute the script's `main()` function to:
   - Load and preprocess data.
   - Run analysis, predictive modeling, and profitability calculations.
   - Export key insights and visualizations for reporting and dashboard integration.

## Features & Functions
### Data Loading and Preprocessing
- **`load_performance_data`**: Connects to the SQL database to load data.
- **`preprocess_data`**: Cleans and formats the data by handling missing values and date parsing.

### Analysis and Modeling
- **`performance_analysis`**: Generates visualizations for spend and ROI by channel, saved as PNG images for reporting.
- **`budget_prediction`**: Uses Gradient Boosting to predict future budget needs based on past data, providing accurate forecasts.
- **`attribution_analysis`**: Performs multi-touch attribution to evaluate each channelâ€™s contributions to conversions, with results exported to CSV.
- **`incrementality_analysis`**: Conducts A/B testing using statistical methods to analyze incremental lift from campaigns.
- **`profitability_metrics`**: Calculates CPA, LTV, and profitability, enabling detailed financial analysis.

### Reporting
- **`generate_dashboard`**: Exports key metrics (e.g., Total Spend, Total Conversions, Average ROI) as a CSV file, ready for visualization in Google Data Studio or similar platforms.

## Example Outputs
- **Visualizations**:
  - `marketing_spend_over_time.png`: Line plot showing marketing spend over time by channel.
  - `roi_by_channel.png`: Bar plot illustrating ROI by marketing channel.
- **CSV Reports**:
  - `channel_attribution.csv`: Results from attribution analysis per channel.
  - `metrics_summary.csv`: Summary metrics including Total Spend, Total Conversions, and Average ROI.

## Requirements
- **Data**: Database must include recent and accurate marketing performance data.
- **Environment**: Python 3.7+ with necessary libraries.
- **Permissions**: Script should have permissions to read from the database and write output files.

# Quantum Cognition Platform (QCP) 

## Overview

The **Quantum Cognition Platform (QCP)** is a Python-based simulation tool designed to aid businesses in strategic decision-making. It combines elements of quantum-inspired modeling, historical strategy recall, leadership style simulation, sentiment analysis, and interactive advising. QCP serves as an innovative foundation, showcasing how businesses can leverage advanced AI to make more informed, adaptive, and ethical decisions.

## Features

1. **Quantum-Inspired Market Scenario Engine**: Simulates various market scenarios by calculating probabilities, risks, and opportunities, and recommending actions based on a quantum-inspired random sampling approach.

2. **Collective Memory System**: Provides strategic advice based on historical business scenarios. The system recalls relevant strategies for current scenarios, helping businesses learn from past experiences.

3. **Leadership Simulation**: Offers insights inspired by various leadership styles, allowing users to see strategies as influenced by hypothetical leaders.

4. **Ethical and Reputational Safeguard Analysis**: Evaluates the ethical and reputational impact of a business decision using NLP sentiment analysis, ensuring socially responsible decision-making.

5. **Adaptive AI Advisor**: A question-and-answer advisor that provides tailored advice on common business queries.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Transformers library**: Required for NLP sentiment analysis (`transformers` package from Hugging Face)
- **TensorFlow**: Optional, only needed if using TensorFlow-based sentiment analysis model

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy transformers
   ```

3. (Optional) Install TensorFlow for additional compatibility:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

## Usage

Run the script by executing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python quantum_cognition_platform.py
```

Upon running, the script will output results from each module:

1. **Quantum-Inspired Market Simulation**: Lists simulated market scenarios with probabilities, risks, opportunities, and suggested actions.
2. **Collective Memory System**: Displays relevant past decisions based on a specified scenario.
3. **Leadership Simulation**: Outputs a strategy inspired by a hypothetical leaderâ€™s style.
4. **Ethical Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of a specified decision and outputs a reputation score.
5. **Adaptive AI Advisor**: Responds to a specified business query with strategic advice.

## Customization

### Modifying the Collective Memory System
To add or modify past business scenarios and strategies, update the `memory_database` list in the script's **Collective Memory System** section. This list holds entries as dictionaries with `scenario` and `strategy` keys.

### Leadership Styles
Customize leadership styles and strategies by modifying the `decision_patterns` dictionary in the **Leadership Simulation** section. This dictionary maps hypothetical leaders with unique strategic approaches.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced NLP Models**: Incorporate more sophisticated models for ethical and reputational analysis.
- **Dynamic Scenario Generation**: Add more complex algorithms to enhance the realism of scenario generation.
